# M38 JavaScript REST API

I undertook this project as part of a coding bootcamp, and it was an introduction into creating JS webservers and the use of ExpressJS, BCryptJS and Mongoose to create a functional back end for a future project.

## Installation and running of this application

On cloning this repository navigate to its' root folder and open a command line interface and run `npm i` to download all of its requirement packages.
After this you can run the server by running `node .\src\server.js`

From there you must (currently) use a REST API client like ThunderClient,Insomnia, Postman, etc. to send requests to the endpoints listed below

### Environment Variables:

- `MONGO_URI`
  > This is your connection string to a Mongo Database.
